# Cortical-dynamics
Data set used to examine rich-club dynamics in cortical microcircuits.

Each file represents simultaneously recorded neurons from one animal.

unitactivity.spiketimes{i} gives the spike times in seconds of the ith unit.  

unitactivity.waves{i} gives the mean spike waveform in microvolts of the ith unit, in time steps of 1/samplingrate.
